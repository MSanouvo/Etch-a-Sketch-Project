# Etch-a-Sketch-Project

A small program using DOM manipulation and event handlers to draw on a square canvas.
"new grid" allows users to reset the grid with a desired size (max: 120 squares wide)
- grid size affects size of the pen. Larger grids leave smaller trails.

Things to improve:
- change event handler to holding mousedown for more control of the pen (mouse cursor)
- allow change of color to draw with
- add option to grant opacity to the pen
- improve general look of the webpage
